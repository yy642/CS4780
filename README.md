# Trumps-Tweets
In this project, a binary classification on which device is used to write Turmp's tweet are developed. It's been hypothesized that President Trump tweets only from his android phone and that someone else tweets from his account using an iphone. The text of the tweet and other contextual information are used to predict where each tweet came from.
